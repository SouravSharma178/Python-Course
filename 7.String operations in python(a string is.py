#String operations in python(a string is anything written in quotes)
print("hello" + "world") # adding two strings together is called string concatenation

print("5"+"5")

print(5+5)

print('5'+'5')

print("hello"+"I"+"am"+"happy")

# print("hello"+5)  this will produce an error as well.We cannot concatenate string with a number

print("hello"+"5")

print('hello5')

print("rob"*3) # this will print rob 3 times

print("rob"*10) # this will print rob 10 times

# print("rob"*"10") this will throw an error as we cannot multiply string with a string
