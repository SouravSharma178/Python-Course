#Basics of Python
# Always remember that variables do not need to declared in python,we can directly print them
print('Hello World')

print(200 + 300)

print(200-300)

print(75*32)

print(5*6*(5+89))

print(500/100)     #single slash will give us the float value

print(500//100)    #double slash will give us the float value

print(6.0*3)       # whenever integer and float are multiplied the answer is float

print(6*3)

print(22.0+15)
# division by zero is not possible in python just like any other programming language
